##Take Aways

- Data structures are used to organize various data in a logical way
- There are different types of data structures which are primitive and non-primitive
- Some common types of data structures are Integer, Floats, Strings, Booleans
- One new data type I used in the challenge was the type Runnable, which is useful in passing a method for an object as a parameter
- Non-Primitive are Arrays, Lists, Tuple, Dictionary, Set, File
- Algorithms can deal with data structures and extract / reorder information
- Objected Oriented Programming uses classes and objects to create objects and instances of them -> constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism which could have been used for this project
- Common Data Structures are Arrays/Lists, Dictionaries/Hashmaps

here is an example of type Runnable I used:
