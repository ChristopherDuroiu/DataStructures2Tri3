```

- Data structures are used to organize various data in a logical way
- There are different types of data structures which are primitive and non-primitive
- Some common types of data structures are Integer, Floats, Strings, Booleans
- One new data type I used in the challenge was the type Runnable, which is useful in passing a method for an object as a parameter
- Non-Primitive are Arrays, Lists, Tuple, Dictionary, Set, File
- Algorithms can deal with data structures and extract / reorder information
- Objected Oriented Programming uses classes and objects to create objects and instances of them -> constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism which could have been used for this project
- Common Data Structures are Arrays/Lists, Dictionaries/Hashmaps
```


here is an example of type Runnable I used:

```
- linked lists are important to future cs classes
- linked lists on fringed end of ap exam
- deque means delete first element
- enque means add to que (the end)
- push, pop, delete, deque all mean same thing
- tail changes as you add
- always deque from the front, next object becomes head as you deque
- when tail is dequed, null ensues
- challenge three connects the head and tail
- current tail can point to new tail
- linked lists function very similar to array lists
- removeFirst(), add(), add(index, element) were all functions I used in the challenge

```
- An enque function needs a paramter as shown below: <br />

- While a deque function does not need a paramter as shown below <br />

- Deque and enque function very similarly, and I used method printList in both the enque and deque functions themseleves to complete the respective portions of the challenge <br />
